		<h3>
		Description of the Condition
		</h3>
		
		<p>
		Obesity is a multifactorial disorder characterised by an imbalance between intake and daily requirement of nutrients. The causes of obesity are complex and include genetic, psychological, biochemical, environmental, social and economic factors. In clinical practice, overweight and obesity are usually defined by the body mass index (BMI) (IOTF; WHO 2011). Furthermore, obesity can be
		grouped into three classes, depending on the degree of severity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		More than one and a half billion adults worldwide are overweight, of which 500 million are obese (WHO 2011). At least one in two people is now overweight or obese in over half of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and projections suggest than in some countries more than two out of three people will be obese by 2020 (OECD 2012). In the European Union, the proportion of overweight and obese people in the adult population varied in 2008/09 between 36.9% and
		56.7% for women and between 51% and 69.3% for men (EHIS 2009). In Spain, over half of the adult population are overweight and 17% of these are obese (EHIS-S 2009).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		People who are overweight are much more likely to develop risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (NHLBI 2000). Obesity is associated with a large number of health problems (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine-metabolic, musculoskeletal, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases as well as certain types of cancer (Guh 2009; NHLBI 2000)). It also has an important impact on individual self esteem and self image, and limits health-related quality of life. Overweight individuals showing one or more obesity-related conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension) could have a risk of cardiovascular disease comparable to obese individuals. The specific level of risk associated with a given level of overweight or obesity may vary with race/ethnicity, and also with age, gender and societal conditions (NHLBI 2000).

		<h3>
		Interventions
		</h3>
					
		<p>
		There is a diverse array of interventions available for obesity and being overweight, although the main interventions can be broadly classified into non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical. Non-pharmacological ’lifestyle’ interventions aim to decrease the nutrient intake and to increase the daily energy requirements through increase in physical activity, such as engaging in exercise (a planned, structured and repetitive physical activity). These interventions can be combined with psychological behavioural interventions to improve adherence to treatment and induce permanent change in the obese or overweight individual. Specific strategies include self monitoring of both eating habits and physical activity, stress management, stimulus control, problem solving, contingency management, cognitive restructuring and social support (NHLBI 2000). These interventions constitute the cornerstone of any weight-reduction programme in overweight and obese individuals, whatever the degree of severity. 
		</p>
								
		<p>
		Most interventions target the individual (such as <a href="http://www.digitalhealthscorecard.com/" target="_blank">the Digital Health Scorecard, by Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>) but there are other more general approaches that focus also on the individual’s environment, such as public health policies or family or workplace interventions. Other interventions with a more holistic approach have been proposed, either complementary therapies targeting weight loss (Cho 2009; Pittler 2004; Pittler 2005) or new proposals focusing on health outcomes rather than weight loss (Bacon 2011).

			<h4>Davos 2013: Open Forum: War against Obesity - Fat Invoice?</h4>
			<p>
			Obesity is the fastest-growing chronic disease, killing 2.8 million adults every year. With 1.4 billion overweight adults, we live in a world where unhealthy food, labour-saving devices, motorized transport and sedentary work are prevalent, and fast food sales are on the rise, blurring the boundaries between meals and snacks. (We recommend watching the entire video, but in particular the introduction from 0-7:30 minutes and Dean Fried's comments on why obesity is such a difficult issue to tackle, from 23-27 minutes.)

			<h4>The Obesity Epidemic: Why Have We Failed?</h4>
			<p>
			Lewis Kuller will discuss how obesity is an example of a common source epidemic due to changes or introduction of new behaviors, i.e. lifestyles, which result in introduction of new "agents," such as fast foods or calorically dense foods, into a receptive environment. The development of technology for mass production of low-cost, high-calorically dense foods has resulted in economic advantage, mass marketing, and social acceptability. Over time, this has caused increased risks of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, etc. Successful control of the obesity epidemic requires an understanding of the interrelationship between the host, the agents and the environmental factors.
